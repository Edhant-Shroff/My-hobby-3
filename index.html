        <p> Reading is the process of taking in the sense or meaning of letters,
            symbols,
            etc.,
            especially by sight or touch. For educators and researchers,
            reading is a multifaceted process involving such areas as word recognition,
            orthography (spelling),
            alphabetics,
            phonics,
            phonemic awareness,
            vocabulary,
            comprehension,
            fluency,
            and motivation. <br> <br> Other types of reading and writing,
            such as pictograms (e.g., a hazard symbol and an emoji),
            are not based on speech based writing systems.The common link is the interpretation of symbols to extract the meaning from the visual notations or tactile signals (as in the case of Braille). <br> <br> There is a growing body of evidence which illustrates the importance of reading for pleasure for both educational purposes as well as personal development.Photo: Reading a newspaper in Catania,
            Sicily. Reading is typically an individual activity,
            done silently,
            although on occasion a person reads out loud for other listeners;
            or reads aloud for one's own use, for better comprehension. Before the reintroduction of separated text in the late Middle Ages, the ability to read silently was considered rather remarkable.
            <br> Major predictors of an individual's ability to read both alphabetic and non-alphabetic scripts are oral language skills,phonological awareness, rapid automatized naming and verbal IQ.
            <br> As a leisure activity,
            children and adults read because it is pleasant and interesting. In the US,
            about half of all adults read one or more books for pleasure each year.About 5% read more than 50 books per year.Americans read more if they: have more education,
            read fluently and easily,
            are female,
            live in cities,
            and have higher socioeconomic status.Children become better readers when they know more about the world in general,
            and when they perceive reading as fun rather than another chore to be performed.

        <h4> I am a Bag maker</h4> <br> <br>
        <p> A bag (also known regionally as a sack) is a common tool in the form of a non-rigid [container]. The use of bags predates recorded history,
            with the earliest bags being no more than lengths of animal skin,
            cotton,
            or woven plant fibers,
            folded up at the edges and secured in that shape with strings of the same material. <br> <br> Despite their simplicity,
            bags have been fundamental for the development of human civilization,
            as they allow people to easily collect loose materials such as berries or food grains,
            and to transport more items than could readily be carried in the hands.The word probably has its origins in the Norse word baggi,
            from the reconstructed Proto-Indo-European bʰak,
            but is also comparable to the Welsh baich (load, bundle),
            and the Greek Τσιαντουλίτσα (Chandulícha, load). <br> <br> Cheap disposable paper bags and plastic shopping bags are very common in the retail trade as a convenience for shoppers,
            and are often supplied by the shop for free or for a small fee Customers may also take their own shopping bags to use in shops,
            these are more commonly known as tote bags or shoppers tote. Although,
            paper had been used for purposes of wrapping and padding in ancient China since the 2nd century BC,
            the first use of paper bags (for preserving the flavor of tea) in China came during the later Tang Dynasty (618–907 AD). </p> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
